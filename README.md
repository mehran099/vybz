# VYBE 💬  
**Version 0.1**  

**VYBE** is a Gen-Z–driven anonymous chat platform built for people who crave genuine, private, and fast online conversations. No accounts. No tracking. Just connection.  

Currently under development, VYBE aims to become the go-to place for privacy-focused digital socializing — a next-generation alternative to noisy, over-monetized chat spaces.

---

## 🚀 Vision  
VYBE was born out of a simple frustration: social platforms talk about “community,” but they track, sell, and manipulate their users. We’re flipping that script.  

**Goal:** Build a real-time, privacy-first chat experience for a new internet generation that values freedom and authenticity over metrics.
